                <video src="./img/nikita.mp4?autoplay=false" height="500px" width="300px" controls class="nikitavid" alt="Nikita Subedi"></video>
                <p class="nikitatxt">First on the list is our beloved Miss World, named Nikita Subedi also can be called as Luna Subedi.
                She was one of the two female friends or so you can call 'bestfriend' I've ever had.
                I am currently not sure on what I am to her but I hope I haven't left any bad impression on her.
                She was a typical female friend who we can also call our second mother. Nikita was one of the most mature friend I had.
                Especially for me, without her my highschool would've been awful, She was the one I was closest with (atleast i hope so).
                Without her I would've been sitting in highschool trying to clear my backlogs lmao.<br><br>

                Now coming to this video, I was taken duing our first night stay of college trip at Lumbini.
                All of us had great time there, except for some peoples who had terrible time with their stomach lmao.
                It was a very nice place, and it also had like two long walking path which lead to the temple and back to the hotel,
                but the most amazing part was, it had like a small manmade river flowing in between the path, where small boats were circulating.
                Unfortunately, I left the temple earlier than others so I missed my chance for the boat ride. I hope it was amazing for those who were in it.  
                </p>

                <img src="./img/shuvam1.jpg" alt="Shuvam Shrestha" width="300px" height="500px">
                <p class="shuvamtxt">Second on our list is Mr. Genius, named Shuvam Shrestha, he also calls himself as ximabu, which means 'your dad' in english.
                I genuinely don't know why he decided to go on with that name but sure it's his choice.
                So, coming to the topic, he was the one I shared most of my highschool times with, We are still together currently studying in the same college,
                but ngl he is kinda retarted. Both of us loved playing video games and I still do but he isn't much in video games currently.
                He enjoys learning new programming language and also loves coding. I genuinely believe that if he continues doing this,
                he'll be able to do such great things in future.<br><br>

                He's fun to be around with, We both share the same sense of humor and he is such a great friend that I'm unable to describe him in words.
                And and he also loves playing guitar, and not being biased, he has a great voice. I don't know what else if left for me to say, so I'll end this here.

                <p class="sabintxt">Third on our list is Mr. Clown, named Sabin Gautam (idk any of his nicknames).
                Straight to the point, I don't have much to say about him, like we share somethings in common like we play some similar games and we are both dumb.
                I don't know what to say about him, like I don't have any clear vision about him.</p>

                <p class="krishatxt">Fourth on our list is Miss. Putali, also known as Krisha Niraula. SHE IS ACTUALLY CRINGE.
                But she's the only girl I still talk with, now I've known her for above 5 years and she's been my bestfriend ever since.
                She is an awesome friend to be around with who shares the same sense of humor as you, and knows all the double meaning statements ðŸ’€.<br><br>
                I believe she was my first female bestfriend, so she holds a special place in my heart.
                I've always enjoyed my time with her except for when she annoys me to take her out to eat momo, LIKE DUDE PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT I'M BROKE ASF.
                Higher secondary school would've been boring asf if I never found a friend like her.<br><br>
                She's an awesome friend and I hope everybody finds a friend like her who will be there with you in need.</p>
